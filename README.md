- Semantic HTML

- I created this template for way to practice programming concepts like semantic HTML and advanced CSS

The semantic HTML strategy is to make it easier for search engines to list this page in one of the first ones if this page were for the Internet (it won't)

#

- Here I made the Netflix homepage based on the website and for the format of notebooks and laptops

The css was used the grid which is the css a little more advanced it was used for better adaptability of the layout in devices of smaller size and resolution

#
- The gratifying part for me was making the css responsive using the media query
- Here i worked for devices a little bigger like ipad or tablet to large size
